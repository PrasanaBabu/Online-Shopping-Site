Open Eclipse Goto File and click Import as WAR file.

Then select this file and use runtime as 9.0.46  

Make sure you have mySQL and have a database named ospjsp or if you want someother name change it in the UserDao file.

Make sure you run createTable file inside  /webapp/table when you run for the first time to create various tables needed for this project.

Hope you have a great experience.
